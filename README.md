# ChromeDB

Read Chromium data (namely, cookies and local storage) straight from disk‚Äî_without_ spinning up the browser. <!-- Yeah, it's called <em>Chrome</em>DB, but `chromiumdb` is a bit of a mouthful for a Go package name. -->

## Description

Chromium-based browsers store cookies and local storage in the following respective databases within the profile directory:

Path | Format | Encrypted
--- | --- | ---
`Cookies` | SQLite | Yes
`Local Storage/leveldb/` | LevelDB | No

This tool reads from those databases, decrypts where necessary, and outputs the data in JSON format for easy parsing on CLI.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

This has only been tested with Arc browser on macOS, but should work with any Chromium-based browser. I'd accept a PR to support decrypting cookies on other operating systems.

### Install

```bash
ùÑ¢ go install -v github.com/noperator/chromedb/cmd/chromedb@latest
```

### Usage

```bash
ùÑ¢ chromedb -h
Usage of chromedb:
  -c	cookies
  -ls
    	local storage
  -p string
    	path to browser profile directory

```

To decrypt cookies for Chromium-based Arc browser, we need to first get its password from the keychain.

```bash
ùÑ¢  export BROWSER_PASSWORD=$(security find-generic-password -wga Arc)
ùÑ¢ chromedb -c -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/Arc/User\ Data/Profile\ 1/ |
    shuf -n 2 |
    jq '.encrypted_value = "<ENCRYPTED>"'

{
  "domain": ".geeksforgeeks.org",
  "name": "gfg_theme",
  "encrypted_value": "<ENCRYPTED>",
  "value": "gfgThemeDark"
}
{
  "domain": "www.citrix.com",
  "name": "renderid",
  "encrypted_value": "<ENCRYPTED>",
  "value": "rend01"
}
```

Local storage is unencrypted and doesn't require a password.

```bash
ùÑ¢ chromedb -ls -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/Arc/User\ Data/Profile\ 1/ |
    shuf -n 2 |
    jq

{
  "storage_key": "https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com",
  "script_key": "ClientSidePersistence",
  "charset": "ISO-8859-1",
  "mime": "text/plain",
  "conversions": [
    "strconv.Quote"
  ],
  "value": "ClientContext/CLIENTCONTEXT:=visitorId%3D"
}
{
  "storage_key": "https://github.com",
  "script_key": "ref-selector:greasysock/railscookie:branch",
  "charset": "ISO-8859-1",
  "mime": "application/json",
  "conversions": [],
  "value": {
    "refs": [
      "master"
    ],
    "cacheKey": "v0:1554731422.0"
  }
}
```

## Back matter

Three outstanding posts from CCL Solutions Group that helped me understand Chromium data storage:
- [LevelDB](https://www.cclsolutionsgroup.com/post/hang-on-thats-not-sqlite-chrome-electron-and-leveldb)
- [IndexedDB](https://www.cclsolutionsgroup.com/post/indexeddb-on-chromium)
- [Local storage](https://www.cclsolutionsgroup.com/post/chromium-session-storage-and-local-storage)

I almost didn't write this tool as there are many others that do this kind of thing already. The most widely used ones are written in Python ([`pycookiecheat`](https://github.com/n8henrie/pycookiecheat/blob/dev/src/pycookiecheat/chrome.py) for cookies, [`ccl_chrome_indexeddb`](https://github.com/cclgroupltd/ccl_chrome_indexeddb/blob/master/ccl_chromium_localstorage.py) for local storage)‚Äîbut I avoid using Python if possible due [nightmarish environment management](https://xkcd.com/1987/). There are a few Go-based cookie-dumping utilities, but they:

- don't read from disk, and instead abuse the [remote debugging port](https://blog.chromium.org/2011/05/remote-debugging-with-chrome-developer.html) to launch a browser and dump unencrypted cookies ([`WhiteChocolateMacademiaNut`](https://github.com/slyd0g/WhiteChocolateMacademiaNut), [`chromecookiestealer`](https://github.com/magisterquis/chromecookiestealer), [`chrome-dump`](https://github.com/lesnuages/chrome-dump), [`go-chrome-stealer`](https://github.com/omaidf/go-chrome-stealer))
- only work on Windows ([`gookies`](https://github.com/CCob/gookies))
- are "obsolete" ([`gostealer`](https://github.com/4kord/gostealer)) or "demo-only" ([`go-stealer`](https://github.com/idfp/go-stealer))
- do read from disk, but either used too many hardcoded values or were too complex for my needs ([`go-chrome-cookies`](https://github.com/teocci/go-chrome-cookies), [`chrome-cookie`](https://github.com/muyids/chrome-cookie), [`ChromeDecryptor`](https://github.com/wat4r/ChromeDecryptor), [`chrome-cookie-cutter`](https://github.com/saranrapjs/chrome-cookie-cutter), [`chrome-cookie-decrypt`](https://github.com/kinghrothgar/chrome-cookie-decrypt), [`chrome-cookies`](https://github.com/igara/chrome-cookies), [`cookies`](https://github.com/creachadair/cookies))

I wasn't able to find _any_ Go-based tools that specifically parse local storage (though [`leveldb-cli`](https://github.com/cions/leveldb-cli) does read LevelDB, which is a good start).

### To-do

- [ ] Decrypt cookies on Linux, Windows
- [ ] Specify a domain to filter on
- [ ] Clean up error handling, logging
